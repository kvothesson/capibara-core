## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Capibara Core, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT disclose publicly
- Do not create public issues or pull requests
- Do not discuss the vulnerability in public forums
- Do not share information about the vulnerability until it has been resolved

### 2. Report privately
Send an email to **security@capibara.dev** with the following information:

- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability`
- **Description**: Detailed description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: How this vulnerability could be exploited
- **Reproduction steps**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, Docker version, etc.
- **Suggested fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### 3. Response timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (or we'll provide an update on timeline)

### 4. Recognition
If you're the first to report a valid security vulnerability, we'll:
- Add you to our security acknowledgments
- Provide a security researcher badge
- Consider a security bounty (for critical vulnerabilities)

## Security Features

### Code Execution Security
- **Sandboxed Execution**: All generated scripts run in isolated Docker containers
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and execution time limits enforced
- **Network Isolation**: Scripts run with no network access by default
- **Read-only Filesystem**: Container filesystem is read-only by default

### Code Analysis
- **AST Scanning**: Static analysis of generated code before execution
- **Pattern Detection**: Regex-based detection of dangerous patterns
- **Import Blocking**: Dangerous Python modules are blocked by default
- **Function Blocking**: Dangerous functions (eval, exec, etc.) are blocked

### Security Policies
- **Strict Policy**: Maximum security with minimal allowed operations
- **Moderate Policy**: Balanced security for most use cases
- **Permissive Policy**: Minimal restrictions for trusted environments
- **Custom Policies**: User-defined security rules and restrictions

### Audit Logging
- **Security Events**: All security violations are logged
- **Execution Logs**: Script execution details are recorded
- **Access Logs**: API access and usage patterns are tracked
- **Compliance**: Audit trails for regulatory compliance

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Use Strong API Keys**: Generate strong, unique API keys for LLM providers
2. **Limit Permissions**: Use the most restrictive security policy possible
3. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly review execution logs and security events
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep Capibara Core updated to the latest version
5. **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables, not in code

### For Developers
1. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Documentation**: Security implications of changes must be documented
5. **Incident Response**: Clear procedures for security incident response

## Security Architecture

### Container Security
- **Base Images**: Minimal, security-hardened base images
- **User Privileges**: Scripts run as non-root user
- **Capabilities**: Dropped all Linux capabilities by default
- **Seccomp Profiles**: System call filtering enabled
- **AppArmor**: Application-level access control (when available)

### Network Security
- **No Network Access**: Scripts cannot access external networks by default
- **API Isolation**: LLM API calls are made from the host, not containers
- **TLS Encryption**: All external communications use TLS
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limits prevent abuse

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted when stored
- **Encryption in Transit**: All data transmission encrypted
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and stored
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old data

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Triage reported vulnerability
- Assess severity and impact
- Assign internal tracking number
